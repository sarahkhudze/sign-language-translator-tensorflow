🧾 Chichewa Sign Language Recognition System 

A real-time sign language recognition prototype for Chichewa , Malawi’s national language. This system detects hand gestures from a webcam and translates them into text — supporting both rule-based classification (MediaPipe)  and deep learning classification (TensorFlow CNN model) . 

🎯 Goal : Enable inclusive communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Malawi using AI and computer vision.
